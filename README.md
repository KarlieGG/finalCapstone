# Capstone-Project-VII-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning

For this Capstone project, we are first going to perform clustering techniques on the dataset provided and analyse which method is the best. 
Secondly, we will perform PCA on our dataset to investigate if it helps the clustering of the observations.


## Dataset
This dataset is from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge (link). A description of the data is given as: 
“This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the
percent of the population living in urban areas.”

- EDA
- Data pre-processing
- PCA
- Hierarchical clustering
- K–means
